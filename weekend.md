The weekend is free time - you might want to take a hike in the Mountain Research Station to explore Nederland. We will run a shuttle from the MRS to Boulder in the morning of the Saturday returning on Saturday evening. If you wish to spend the night in Boulder please make your own hotel arrangements. *Note you will have a couple of hours to explore Boulder next Wednesday after the trip to NEON
