# Weekend

The weekend is free time!

Possible activities include:

- Hiking around the Mountain Research Station 
    - we can provide trail maps for the surrounding area
    
    
- Visiting Boulder 
    - We will run a shuttle from the MRS to Boulder in the morning of the Saturday returning on Saturday evening. 
    - If you wish to spend the night in Boulder please make your own hotel arrangements. *Note you will have a couple of hours to explore Boulder next Wednesday after the trip to NEON 


- Visiting Nederland
    - There is a bus that runs between Boulder and Nederland, so it is possible to visit both in one day.
