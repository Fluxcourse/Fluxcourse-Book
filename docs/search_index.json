(Eds.). (2012). Eddy covariance: a practical guide to measurement and data analysis. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. Verma, S. B., Baldocchi, D. D., Anderson, D. E., Matt, D. R., &amp; Clement, R. J. (1986). Eddy fluxes of CO2, water vapor, and sensible heat over a deciduous forest. Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 36(1-2), 71-91. Baldocchi, D., Falge, E., Gu, L., Olson, R., Hollinger, D., Running, S., … &amp; Fuentes, J. (2001). FLUXNET: A new tool to study the temporal and spatial variability of ecosystem–scale carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy flux densities. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82(11), 2415-2434. 2.2 Photosynthesis and the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry model The Farquhar model is one of the most important model’s in our field. With some impressive insight from a collaborative team of complementary scientists, the model forms an elegant backbone to the study of the carbon cycle. Read the Farquhar et al 1980 Paper and use the ‘Discussion’ as a guide for your reading. 2.3 Linking models and data We were excited that Belinda Medlyn came to the course for week 1 in 2016. She talked about several different issues but one that’s sure to come up every year is how we devise experiments and modelling efforts to be complementary. 2.4 FolderRemote Sensing of GPP It’s incredibly useful to be able to remotely sense vegetation on the Earth. However many scientists don’t understand the limitations of this technique. Tristan Quaife and Bill Smith have dealt with this issue in week two usually. The paper led by Faith Ann Heinsch has a host of co-authors from a wide range of different fields. Read the paper and see if you can answer the questions posed in the discussion. 2.5 A primer in Data Assimilation using MCMC A few years ago we used the second week of the course as a template for this paper - it’s a gentle introduction to data assimilation using MCMC. There are links to code you can download yourself via John’s webpage: http://web.augsburg.edu/~zobitz/dataAssimilation.html 2.6 Where are the sources and sinks of Carbon around the globe? In week two Dave Schimel comes by to give his ‘chalk talk’ it’s rarely the same twice but one of the key papers Dave will talk about is Tans, Fung &amp; Takahashi 1990 from Science. It’s a short paper but it’s dense. The first time I read it, I needed to read it 4 times to understand it. Take a look at the paper and the disucssion questions. This will set you up for Dave’s talk and it’s a great overview for the theme of the course. You might also like to read Dave’s editorial on current issues in the C cycle, and also the 2014 paper that was based on the chalk talk. Schimel, D., Stephens, B. B., &amp; Fisher, J. B. (2015). Effect of increasing CO2 on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(2), 436-441.

If you want to see the files you can go into your R directory on your computer and you can find it in the extdata folder within the PEcAN.photosynthesis package. For example : C:\\Users\\dmoore\\Documents\\R\\R-3.4.0\\library\\PEcAn.photosynthesis\\extdata The command system.file()` in R allows you to call up folders relevant to a particular package. This commant looks in the folder, scans for files with aci or aq in the filename and writes these names \\(and their full path\\) to the R object “filenames”. ## Get list of LI-COR 6400 file names (ASCII not xls) filenames &lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, paste0(&quot;flux-course-&quot;,rep(1:6,each=2),c(&quot;aci&quot;,&quot;aq&quot;)), package = &quot;PEcAn.photosynthesis&quot;) # filenames is 12 character variables # These files are licor files ... not CSV files, not XLSX files # ... just the file that comes right off the machine ... it has no file extension # PEcAN.photosynthesis contains a command call read.licor() ...I bet you can guess what it does! # read.Licor will load an individual licor file ... if you have one. ## Load files to a list master = lapply(filenames, read_Licor) 7.1.2.2 Using your own data You can download this year’s data as a ZIP file at https://github.com/Fluxcourse/2017_LI-COR You can do the same process with your own data …. you just need to point R to those data and load em up into a big list. my_data &lt;- &quot;path_to_your_data&quot; # for example: my_data &lt;- &quot;~/Downloads/2017_LI-COR-master/07102017PSC0365_CO2response&quot; master = read_Licor(my_data) 7.1.3 QA/QC Checks The code below performs a set of interactive QA/QC checks on the LI-COR data that’s been loaded. master[[1]] &lt;- Licor_QC(master[[1]]) If you have more than one file loaded into the `master` list, you may only want to run the function for one file, rather than looping over all the files. master[[1]] &lt;- Licor_QC(master[[1]]) 7.2 Stomatal Conductance Modeling Exercise: Below is a dataset containing meteorological observations and tower-derived GPP estimates collected at MMSF during the course of a severe drought occurring in 2012.
